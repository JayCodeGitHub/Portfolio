        Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an
         advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, 
         and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is 
         building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences 
         at Upstatement for a variety of clients.`],
